# Naruto Shippuden Quiz 

This quiz website is made for the project assessment for module 2 of the Front End Developer course, and it is to showcase on the knowledge I have gained from the lessons in the module about using JavaScript to enhance the websites I can make alongside HTML and CSS. On the other hand, this quiz is for anyone to participate in and test their knowledge about the anime Naruto Shippuden and if they aren't a fan they might even be intrigued with the show and want to watch it. 

## Usability

The site is responsive on both desktop and mobile devices.   
This can be seen with the @media screen resolutions stated on the css stylesheet that tell the browser the settings for each element depending on what the devices screen size is. So if the screen size is around 1025px or more, the content would be big and fit the screen. On the other hand if the screen size is around 600px or less, the content would be smaller on small screens but still be visible and readable due to the values given to the elements with the CSS properties given to those elements in the CSS stylesheet.
