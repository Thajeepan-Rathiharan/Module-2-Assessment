# Naruto Shippuden Quiz 

This quiz website is made for the project assessment for module 2 of the Front End Developer course, and it is to showcase on the knowledge I have gained from the lessons in the module about using JavaScript to enhance the websites I can make alongside HTML and CSS. On the other hand, this quiz is for anyone to participate in and test their knowledge about the anime Naruto Shippuden and if they aren't a fan they might even be intrigued with the show and want to watch it. 

## Usability

The site is responsive on both desktop and mobile devices.   
This can be seen with the @media screen resolutions stated on the css stylesheet that tell the browser the settings for each element depending on what the devices screen size is. So if the screen size is around 1025px or more, the content would be big and fit the screen. On the other hand if the screen size is around 600px or less, the content would be smaller on small screens but still be visible and readable due to the values given to the elements with the CSS properties given to those elements in the CSS stylesheet.

## Features of the site

* Feature 1 - Fully functioning quiz
* Feature 2 - Responsive design for desktop, tablet and mobile devices
* Feature 3 - Timer that counts how long is taken for the users attempt at the quiz once they press the 'start     quiz' button. 
* Feature 4 - Links to creators Github account and LinkedIn account

## Technology used

* Visual Studio Code was used as the code editor for this project.
* HTML is the coding language used to make the basic structure of the site via the headings, texts and images.
* CSS is used to style the HTML code of the website.
* JavaScript is used to make the site interactive.
* Git provides source control to commit and push code to the repository.
* Github is used to host live sites.
* FontAwesome is for website icons in the footer of the site.
* Favicon.io is used to create the website favicon. 

## Testing of the site

I tested my website using online tools such as: 
* [HTML WC3 Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
* [CSS WC3 Markup Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
* [JavaScript Validation Servce]()

First the website was put through the [HTML WC3 Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) and it came back with no errors on the html validator.



Then the website was also put through the [CSS WC3 Markup Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and it came back with no errors on the css validator.

Finally the website was tested through the [JavaScript Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) and it came back with no errors on the jshint validator.

## Deployment

The website was made using Visual Studio Code, a local git directory was used for version control and then bought to life using Github after the files were uploaded into a repository. To do this I initiated the git repository with 'git innit', then used 'git status'  to see which of my un-tracked files had not been added to the new repository. I used 'git commit -m "added in a specific message" to commit my changed files to the repository.  
After realising I had source control on Visual Studio Code, I was committing to my github repository via the source control tool from Git adding my commits with a message of what change I made to the code.

## Credits

I got the questions and buttons layouts from the following [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiLTsxjCmWQ&t=591s).
