# Naruto Shippuden Quiz 
This quiz website is made for the project assessment for module 2 of the Front End Developer course, and it is to showcase on the knowledge I have gained from the lessons in the module about using JavaScript to enhance the websites I can make alongside HTML and CSS. On the other hand, this quiz is for anyone to participate in and test their knowledge about the anime Naruto Shippuden and if they aren't a fan they might even be intrigued with the show and want to watch it.
